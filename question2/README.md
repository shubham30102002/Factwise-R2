You are given a simple React component named Counter which should display:
an integer, starting at 0, in an element with id='value'
a button with id='increment' which increments value when you click on it
a button with id='decrement' which decrements value when you click on it
Currently, it only displays 0 and the buttons do nothing.
 
Your task is to make the buttons work: each click should increase or decrease the value by 1.
